   <p>This week we made cads of prosthetics for animals of our choice. I made tail fins for a shark because there are a ton of people who cut off the fins of sharks and just leave them to die in the ocean. The idea behind the tail is that its like a glove and it will follow the motion of the tail to propel the shark through the water. Four our challenge day we made pb and j sandwichs to demonstrate how specific we have to be with our code.</p>
