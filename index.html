   <h1>September 16th, 2022 1st Website Update</h1>
   <p>All we did was choose whos Rude Goldberg machine we wanted to build, then started building them. For our challenge day we made paper boats and put weights with them, then we saw whos last the longest. Ours stayed up for 5 minutes.</p>
 
   <h1>Spetember 23rd, 2022</h1>
   <p>This week we finished working on our Rube Goldberg machines. We also tested them on Friday but I was sick on that day.</p>

   <h1>October 7th, 2022</h1>
   <p>This week we made cads of prosthetics for animals of our choice. I made tail fins for a shark because there are a ton of people who cut off the fins of sharks and just leave them to die in the ocean. The idea behind the tail is that its like a glove and it will follow the motion of the tail to propel the shark through the water. Four our challenge day we made pb and j sandwichs to demonstrate how specific we have to be with our code.</p>

   <p>This week we created and tested our rocket. I wasnt here to build our rocket but our rocket had a parachute that would shoot out of the top as it came down. Saddly our rocket didnt work because it was leaking air and water and it would just lose the pressure in the bottle.</p>
   
   <h1>November 4th, 2022</h1>
   <p>This week we learned about circuits and tinked them on tinkercad. There was no challenge day.</p>
   
   <h1>November 10th, 2022</h1>
   <p>We continued to learn about circuits and used real circuits, bread boards, and leds. We didn't have to much toruble creating the curcits because it was very similar to tinkercad.</p>
   
   <h1>November 18th, 2022</h1>
   <p>We used the arduino wev editor to flash in different patterns. For this weeks challenge me and my partner (Justin Gutierrez) we went around the school trying to find out if there were more wheels or doors in the school and we ruled that there were more wheels then doors.</p>
   
   <h1>December 2nd, 2022</h1>
   <p>This week we learned about civil engineering and our next projet was making a spaghetti bridge. We had to make different spaghetti bridges with different iterations and try to make the best bridge that can hold the most amount of water for the bridges weight. </p>
   
   <h1>December 9th, 2022</h1>
   <p>We made our first spaghetti bridge and used Julian's CAD design which was 24 inches long and had support beams on the top. We could only use 20 noodles per bridge and we had 100 noodles, so we had 5 attempts. After we created our first iteration we tested it at the end of the week but the bridge broke after holding a cup of water. A syrafoam cups worth so I heard, I was absent :p. </p>
   
   <h1>December 16th, 2022</h1>
   <p>We (aka Julian) started on our second iteration decided to try and make the middle more flexible with large amounts of glue. Unfortunately the bridge ended up warped and cracked on various areas. I then started by making our BEST and final bridge.</p>
   
   <h1>December 20th, 2022</h1>
   <p>This was finals week so I added out final touches to our bridges. We ended up being the one of the last ones testing. When we first tied the bucket to the bridge the middle already started to bend but it ended holding one cup of water like the first moddle so I guess it didn't end up being worse then our first iteration. We didn't move forward making a better bridge but we didn't go backwards making a worse bridge so thats alrighty i guess.</p>

   <h1>March 8th, 2023 Mouse Trap Car Project</h1>
   <p>For our project we decided to build a mouse trap car. We started the first week by researching factors that would effect our car like how to reduce friction on the wheels or over all distance the car would move. We finished the first week by starting the cad for our first iteration. For the second week we finished off the cad and then decided what cad we wanted to use. We also started building our first desin for the car. For the third week we finished the the first design and tested it for the first time. For our second iteration one of the problems was that the wheels were wobbly on the axel of the car so we added cardboard squares on each side of the wheels to keep it straight. That design ended up being our final design that performed fairly well. Our car would have went far but we didnt align the wheels straight enough so the car turned, and it turned straight into the wall.</p>
